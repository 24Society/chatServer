# Just a simple local chat system

Before using, you need to create some directory: groups, userData, votes.
And there must be public.grp, public.dat under groups, and public.vot under votes.

If you want to use dev_helper.py, make sure you have default configure file for the program to read.

It should be used with chatClient.
